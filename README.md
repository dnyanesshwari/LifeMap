# LifeMap
LifeMap is a digital visual diary application that allows users to log personal entries with geolocation, emotional tagging, and multimedia support. Each diary entry is plotted on an interactive map, color-coded based on the user's emotional state, creating a visual "emotion trail" of their life journey.
